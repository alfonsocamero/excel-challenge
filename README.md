The purpose of this project is to analyze the data from kickstarter campaigns to identify trends. 

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

1.	After analyzing the data, it can be concluded that live entertainment proposals, particularly plays, as well as rock music initiatives, seem to do very well in English speaking countries. 
2.	Itâ€™s also evident that documentary campaigns (164 out of 180 successful campaigns were in the US), rock music campaigns, tabletop game campaigns (85% of which were between the US and GB) and hardware campaigns were the only 4 categories with 100% success rate for a sample size of at least 80 campaigns. 
3.	Whether within the top performing categories or not, campaigns launched in the US have the most chance of being successful, followed by campaigns launched in Great Britain, and thirdly, Canada. 



What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some of the limitations of this dataset lie in relatively negligible goal amounts of some campaigns which in turn skew the percentage funded for those entries. 



What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1.	A table featuring the subcategories as rows and the average of percentage funded as values can reveal what subcategories received funding well over 200% of their goal. Such table would reveal that tabletop game campaigns, followed by hardware (particularly in the technology field) campaigns received overwhelming overfunding among all successful campaigns.
